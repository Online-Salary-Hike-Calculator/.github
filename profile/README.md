### How Does a Salary Hike Calculator Work?

#### Formula:

#### Example:

- **Old Salary**: ₹40,000
- **New Salary**: ₹50,000

**Calculation:**

Hike Percentage = ((50,000 - 40,000) / 40,000) x 100 = 25%


This means you’ve received a 25% salary hike. Tools like HR Calcy automate this process, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.
